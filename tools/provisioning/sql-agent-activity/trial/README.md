# Finite SQL Agent signed-module trial

This Windows/.NET 10 library provides `TrialCoordinator.PreviewAsync`, `RunAsync` and `RecoverAsync`.
The caller supplies one dedicated nonpooled SQL17 sysadmin connection using the enrolled TCP endpoint,
integrated authentication, validated TLS, the certificate host name, `master`, and no transparent
reconnection. The actual collector Windows account remains a separate, nonsysadmin identity.

`PreviewAsync` reads the existing login/user mapping and catalog baseline in a rolled-back transaction.
It refuses existing trial objects, incomplete metadata visibility, unexpected platform/build, and
offline databases. No trial object or permission is created by preview.

`RunAsync` creates seven fixed objects: an unprivileged schema owner, its schema, the pinned
procedure, master certificate and certificate login, and matching public certificate and user in
msdb. If the existing Windows login has no master user, the trial also creates one temporary master
user for that exact login and records its new ID. An existing user is preserved; same-name or SID
conflicts are refused. The signer receives `VIEW SERVER SECURITY STATE`, msdb `CONNECT`, and `SELECT` on syssessions
and sysjobactivity. The existing monitor receives only module `EXECUTE`. Private signing material
is removed before the installed snapshot is accepted. Five grants are explicitly issued. A newly
created monitor user's zero or one SQL-created CONNECT grant is captured exactly; no separate
CONNECT grant is issued to that user. No existing service is restarted or admitted.
The newly created certificate login's automatic CONNECT SQL and the newly created WITHOUT LOGIN
schema owner's CONNECT are revoked before verification; neither is needed by these helper principals.
Existing principals are never targeted by those REVOKEs. The exact five-grant check remains strict.
Microsoft documents automatic CONNECT SQL on [login creation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-login-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17).

The protected receipt at `%ProgramData%\SqlObserverAgentActivityTrials\<deployment-guid>\receipt.json`
records the original instance/database GUIDs, monitor SID/mappings/permissions and exact installed
object IDs, owners, certificate/signature evidence, and grants. Only Administrators and SYSTEM have
access. No password is recorded. Prepared and verified postimage records are flushed before commit.

After a committed-state check, the trusted callback runs bounded tests as the real monitor. The
callback must join and clean up its process before returning, including on cancellation. Cleanup
has an independent deadline and recaptures the exact postimage before removal, then verifies the
original baseline after commit, including absence of the temporary monitor user. The user's roles,
ownership, dependencies and exact grants must match before its removal. An uncertain SQL session is closed. If the session is lost or an
object changes, cleanup refuses and preserves the receipt for explicit `RecoverAsync` on a new
reviewed connection. Recovery never adopts objects without an installed postimage.

Catalog checks include static dependencies, duplicate certificates/mappings, roles, ownership and
signatures. They cannot prove absence of arbitrary dynamic SQL consumers. The advisory lock does
not prevent an unrelated sysadmin from editing these objects; qualification requires a controlled
DBA maintenance window. The [2026-10-05 native trial](../../../../artifacts/dashboard-agent-module-trial-2026-10-05/completion.json)
passed all three cases under the actual monitor on SQL17, including signed cross-database reads,
production parsing of 12 rows, and coordinator-verified installation and normal removal restoring
the original baseline and absent master mapping. Direct syssessions SELECT still failed with 229.
Agent was stopped: running-session association and full job visibility remain unqualified.
The protected guest journal was not copied locally; cleanup evidence is the coordinator's live
post-commit baseline verification and returned result. Crash recovery was not exercised.

Pure validation tests are in `sql-tests/` and `../trial-tests/`. The native test class is
`SqlAgentActivitySignedModuleQualificationTests`; it is excluded from ordinary SQL sweeps. Its
three tests cover production parsing under the actual monitor, invalid/NULL bound refusal and
pre-cancelled generic source opening. The last case does not qualify a production module adapter.
The enrolled definition hash alone is not proof of DBA verification. Final managed groups pass
60 pure SQL-plan, 98 journal/guard/privacy, 99 module-contract and 74 source/parser cases;
these separate groups are not an aggregate unique-test count.

This library is qualification tooling. Production module discovery, adapter admission, Agent
session/running-job behavior, explicit-DENY/signature-removal cases and foreign-owner visibility
remain separate work.
